# Tabula Rasa Engine (Forked)
Tabula Rasa is a simple 3D Game Engine developed for educational purposes. Written in C++ and using OpenGL. This project has been done by two students of CITM - UPC (Terrasa, Spain) for the subject Game Engines.
This is a forked version of the engine, right here you can find the link to the original engine: [Master Tabula Rasa Repository](https://github.com/Wilhelman/Tabula-Rasa-Engine).
You might find more information in our [website](https://rohomedesrius.github.io/Tabula-Rasa-Engine/).
